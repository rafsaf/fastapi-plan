# Ok, this is something we get thanks to the Nginx Unit Image.
# We don't need to call stuff like
# curl -X PUT --data-binary @config.json --unix-socket \
#       /path/to/control.unit.sock http://localhost/config/
# to set our configuration
# Becouse as stated in docs https://unit.nginx.org/installation/#docker-images,
# configuration snippets are
# uploaded as to the config section of Unitâ€™s configuration
# That means we only have to copy our config.json file to the folder
# /docker-entrypoint.d/

# OK, that looks strange but here's a explanation from Nginx docs
# https://unit.nginx.org/howto/docker/:

# """ PIP isn't installed by default, so we install it first.
# Next, we install the requirements, remove PIP, and perform image cleanup. """

# Note we use /build/requirements.txt since this is our file
